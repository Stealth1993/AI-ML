# AI & ML Practice

This is my GitHub repo for AI and Machine Learning! I upload code for ML programs, algorithm practice, and small projects to learn and experiment.

## What's Here
- **Algorithms**: ML algorithms like linear regression, k-means, etc.
- **Projects**: Simple AI/ML projects (e.g., text classification, image recognition).
- **Practice**: Coding exercises for algorithms and data processing.
- **Notebooks**: Jupyter notebooks for experiments and visualizations.

Most code is in **Python** using libraries like NumPy, pandas, scikit-learn, and PyTorch.

## How to Use
1. Clone the repo:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Stealth1993/AI-ML.git
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Run scripts or notebooks:
   - For Python files: `python script_name.py`
   - For notebooks: `jupyter notebook`

## Requirements
- Python 3.8+
- Libraries: `numpy`, `pandas`, `scikit-learn`, `pytorch`, `jupyter`
